# My project for SoftUni's course Angular - june 2023
This README will contain instructions on how to run the project, the requirements to do so, a basic description on the project's structure and a basic explanation. For a deep explanation of the angular/front-end/ application go to exam/README and for a deep explanation of the backend go to REST API/README.

# How to run the project and requirements
All you need to run the project is to install the packages of the exam and REST API folders. You need MongoDB installed! Then you need to run the angular project with 'ng s' and the REST API with 'npm start'. A successfull message should appear on both of the terminals.

# How to access to the website after running it
Open a browser by choice and type 'http://localhost:4200'. It should open the angular project in the browser.

# Basic explanation of the structure
I use angular as a front-end framework. The back-end is made by me for the current project using express. For more information read the README files in both exam and REST API folders!

# Basic explanation how the project works
The project is a simple social media based application. Every user can make an account. Each user can have their own profile picture and profile information(biography). Once a user is registered, they can write posts and comments on each post. The post can be only text(description) or include a photo. Each comment includes only text(description). If the user is not logged-in they can only read posts/comments and view user's profiles. There is a follow functionality available if the user is logged in!

# There is a more explanation on the application! Please read the other README files!
